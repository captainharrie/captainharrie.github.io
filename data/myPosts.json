Text reads:\n\nTempest's facial hair growth is pretty slow and sparse, and her hair is also very pale and thus hard to see. She likes the rugged look of a little stubble though, so she lets it grow out a bit before she shaves.\n\nThe next sketch is Tempest, but with dark hair instead. Text reads\n\nI often wonder what Tempest might look like with dark hair... I gave her white hair to give her a colour scheme like seafoam, but dark hair is more common in this world.\n\nNow that I've drawn it, she looks rather handsome like this!\n\nI think she would shave her face more if the hair was darker, but keep a little bit of a scraggly moustache.

This isn‚Äôt because I increased the panel count (indeed, there are many panels that I <i>cut</i> in the revision), but because I was more thoughtful about the panels themselves and what I was communicating with them!</p><p>The dank, musky smell and scent of damp fur may not be something I can <b><i>tell</i></b> my readers about in a picture‚Äîbut if I focus on the puddles on the floor, and show the rats‚Äô wet fur‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll feel how dank it is anyway.</p><p>So, while composing the panels in your comic, consider what you‚Äôre communicating through them, and whether you‚Äôre <i><b>telling</b></i> what happens, or if you‚Äôre <i><b>showing</b></i> your readers what it <b><i>feels like</i></b> to be there and what your characters are going through.</p><p>It‚Äôll help you compose more interesting pages!</p><h1>Step 4: Thumbnailing time babeyyyy</h1><p>The most important thing to understand about thumbnails is <i><b>you are not creating a finished picture, you are thinking about how you want to approach the finished picture, especially its composition</b></i>.</p><p>Thumbnailing is about thinking visually, so <i><b>be prepared to erase things at any moment</b></i>, as you might think of something better the next time you look at it!</p><p>Exactly how refined your thumbnails look is going to vary depending on your purposes and how much thinking you want to do in your thumbnailing pass.</p><p>Myself personally, I like it if when I come to blow up my thumbnail to page size and start drawing the actual page to not have to think about a single thing, which results in my thumbnails doubling as a sketch and going through more than one pass.</p><p>For most people, they‚Äôll have one pass and exclusively focus on planning the layout in their thumbnails.</p><p>Again, I said earlier ‚Äúit‚Äôs harder to rearrange panels on a page than it is words in a text document‚Äù, and by this I mean when you draw a panel and then decide it would work better on the next page you now have to cut that panel from one page and move it onto the next, and now there‚Äôs an empty space that you have to fill on the original page, and on the next page you now have to shift everything about and squeeze it in and move things around to make space for this panel‚Ä¶.</p><p>That‚Äôs a hassle!‚Ä¶ Unless, you‚Äôre working small and loose and nothing has been finalised yet, so you have the freedom to shift things about on the page without worrying about erasing things and filling the space.</p><p>Let it be messy, you‚Äôre thinking things through!</p><p>And the key thing is that even though personally I do multiple passes with my thumbnails, they still begin with the same initial rough noncomittal phase where I can and will delete things without a second thought, and indeed even at their most refined I will still delete a thumbnail if I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs working.</p><p>Once again: <i><b>You‚Äôre not making a beautiful sketch, you‚Äôre thinking about how you want to approach tackling the final page.</b></i></p><p>This is why I do multiple passes myself, I‚Äôm doing an awful lot of thinking upfront. As previously established, I started out doing zero planning and ended up with pages I hated, so now I do perhaps a little too much planning haha, but it works for me!</p><p>I imagine for most people however, you‚Äôll be fine with a little less planning.

The other advice is to describe using all five senses&mdash;sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste.</p><p>With these experiments especially I discovered I prefer to write my scripts in prose format&mdash;one because I grew up reading a lot of books, but more importantly for two because I think this is just as important to do in comics as it is in prose, and writing it in prose first helps me make sure I think about these things.</p><p>This is not to say that I think you should write your script in prose&mdash;how you write your script is entirely up to you and your personal preferences!</p><p>As I said earlier&mdash;what matters is that you write your ideas down in some form. But what I <i>am </i>saying is to think about the 5 senses while you write it in whatever form that is.</p><p>Of course, we only <i>really</i> have sight and sound to work with in a comic, we can&rsquo;t describe the way something smells or how it tastes because we can only use visuals and the occasional onomatopeia, but how you choose to frame your panels will communicate different things!</p><p>Compare now then, the original page I was drawing in 2020, to the final page I ended up with:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/b191cdd234fefd4b374df7549f40d438/69b2f7bb25d82487-af/s640x960/f4e7490528b231f1f82bba266904117eacb135cb.png\" alt=\"A tweet reading: New ideas only seem better because you haven\\'t started making them yet.\" class=\"\"/><span class=\"tmblr-alt-text-helper\">ALT</span></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/bab59520542dd37ffc069b23b83b862b/69b2f7bb25d82487-c7/s640x960/bb5d7359f2aebbb6a0eb7156ffe725f83d3747da.png\" alt=\"A tweet reading: New ideas only seem better because you haven\\'t started making them yet.\" class=\"\"/><span class=\"tmblr-alt-text-helper\">ALT</span></figure><p>I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that the redone page is more immersive. This isn&rsquo;t because I increased the panel count (indeed, there are many panels that I <i>cut</i> in the revision), but because I was more thoughtful about the panels themselves and what I was communicating with them!</p><p>The dank, musky smell and scent of damp fur may not be something I can <b><i>tell</i></b> my readers about in a picture&mdash;but if I focus on the puddles on the floor, and show the rats&rsquo; wet fur&hellip; they&rsquo;ll feel how dank it is anyway.</p><p>So, while composing the panels in your comic, consider what you&rsquo;re communicating through them, and whether you&rsquo;re <i><b>telling</b></i> what happens, or if you&rsquo;re <i><b>showing</b></i> your readers what it <b><i>feels like</i></b> to be there and what your characters are going through.</p><p>It&rsquo;ll help you compose more interesting pages!</p><h1>Step 4: Thumbnailing time babeyyyy</h1><p>The most important thing to understand about thumbnails is <i><b>you are not creating a finished picture, you are thinking about how you want to approach the finished picture, especially its composition</b></i>.</p><p>Thumbnailing is about thinking visually, so <i><b>be prepared to erase things at any moment</b></i>, as you might think of something better the next time you look at it!</p><p>Exactly how refined your thumbnails look is going to vary depending on your purposes and how much thinking you want to do in your thumbnailing pass.</p><p>Myself personally, I like it if when I come to blow up my thumbnail to page size and start drawing the actual page to not have to think about a single thing, which results in my thumbnails doubling as a sketch and going through more than one pass.</p><p>For most people, they&rsquo;ll have one pass and exclusively focus on planning the layout in their thumbnails.</p><p>Again, I said earlier &ldquo;it&rsquo;s harder to rearrange panels on a page than it is words in a text document&rdquo;, and by this I mean when you draw a panel and then decide it would work better on the next page you now have to cut that panel from one page and move it onto the next, and now there&rsquo;s an empty space that you have to fill on the original page, and on the next page you now have to shift everything about and squeeze it in and move things around to make space for this panel&hellip;.</p><p>That&rsquo;s a hassle!&hellip; Unless, you&rsquo;re working small and loose and nothing has been finalised yet, so you have the freedom to shift things about on the page without worrying about erasing things and filling the space.</p><p>Let it be messy, you&rsquo;re thinking things through!</p><p>And the key thing is that even though personally I do multiple passes with my thumbnails, they still begin with the same initial rough noncomittal phase where I can and will delete things without a second thought, and indeed even at their most refined I will still delete a thumbnail if I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s working.</p><p>Once again: <i><b>You&rsquo;re not making a beautiful sketch, you&rsquo;re thinking about how you want to approach tackling the final page.</b></i></p><p>This is why I do multiple passes myself, I&rsquo;m doing an awful lot of thinking upfront. As previously established, I started out doing zero planning and ended up with pages I hated, so now I do perhaps a little too much planning haha, but it works for me!</p><p>I imagine for most people however, you&rsquo;ll be fine with a little less planning. Here&rsquo;s how my thumbnail passes breakdown:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/29e56a8f8799e15c3beb817d5aa45cfb/69b2f7bb25d82487-66/s640x960/146c7b52be907345f6457a18fb14ecfa76c9aa2f.png\" alt=\"A tweet reading: New ideas only seem better because you haven\\'t started making them yet.\" class=\"\"/><span class=\"tmblr-alt-text-helper\">ALT</span></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/83e8d957ebb5df12b718814c21d08401/69b2f7bb25d82487-1e/s640x960/836ab142e8d72d838ed994182c7a27271f885592.png\" alt=\"A tweet reading: New ideas only seem better because you haven\\'t started making them yet.\" class=\"\"/><span class=\"tmblr-alt-text-helper\">ALT</span></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/e838e449e8ac8539bf3303e8f286cb57/69b2f7bb25d82487-3e/s640x960/638d047c6f425da5c4758480266057bf91d19828.png\" alt=\"A tweet reading: New ideas only seem better because you haven\\'t started making them yet.\" class=\"\"/><span class=\"tmblr-alt-text-helper\">ALT</span></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/edd44769bf5e7ba8467f344242cdd690/69b2f7bb25d82487-7f/s640x960/ca188f9750ec8121a325720820793d4bd7111f7e.png\" alt=\"A tweet reading: New ideas only seem better because you haven\\'t started making them yet.\" class=\"\"/><span class=\"tmblr-alt-text-helper\">ALT</span></figure><p>In anycase as you can see, first I focus on how I&rsquo;m going to layout the page and frame the contents of each panel,</p><p>Then I come to the value pass and I think about how I am going to utilise value on the page to guide the eye and provide clarity for foreground and background elements,</p><p>And then if I do a colour script, I think about how I&rsquo;m going to utilise colour to set the mood and retain those values I established before.</p><p><b>The goal here is never to make a nice image</b>, but to make something <b><i>understandable</i></b> and <b><i>thought out</i></b>. <b>It&rsquo;s a plan of attack!</b> By the time I draw the page itself, I know exactly what will go where and how I&rsquo;m going to execute it.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll admit freely, <b>not every page I make is as meticulously planned as the rest</b>, they don&rsquo;t need to be!
